      <p>
        I'm a senior student at HCDE. In my free time, I enjoy playing 
        basketball, soccer, table tennis, and martial arts. When I'm 
        looking to gain weight, I also go to the gym. My favorite team 
        is Manchester City. Although they've faced some challenges 
        recently, I remain a staunch supporter and hope to have the 
        opportunity to watch them play in person in the future.
